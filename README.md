# Wav2Lip-CodeFormer
This is a high-definition speaker mouth shape modification project.
First, I use Wav2Lip to modify the mouth shape, and then use CodeFormer for high-definition processing.
This project has a better effect than Wav2Lip-GFPGAN, because CodeFormer performs better in facial restoration。
